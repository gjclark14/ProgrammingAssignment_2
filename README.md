**Uhhhhhh mpizzle**

We're condensing a sparse matrix.

We create a sparse matrix by using some fun random functions in ```Utilities::generateSparseMatrix()```.

Compile with: ```mpic++ main.cpp -o exec```  


Create 2 matrices and place them into the files "matrix0.txt" and "matrix1.txt" with -r: ```./exec -r``` 


Delete the matrix files with -c: ```./exec -c``` 


Generated files will be in the top level directory.
